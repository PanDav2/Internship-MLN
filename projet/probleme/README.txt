There are several scripts in that area, before I manage to put them altogether, here's a description of the way you should use them and the proper way to do so.
Because I didn't bother yet to check the completness of the Tuffy language (MLN or complete, so Tuffy should be but I'll still have to check for it) I decided to create all possible variable and types.


>> factor.py
